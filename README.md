Problem 1: connectfour

In this problem you will write a program that plays connect four. The program should start by asking the user for the dimensions of the board. Two players proceed by dropping coins into the columns. Coins fall to the bottom, and if a player has 4 coins in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then that player wins the game. See <a href="http://www.connectfour.org/connect-4-online.php">http://www. </a><a href="http://www.connectfour.org/connect-4-online.php">connectfour.org/connect-4-online.php</a> if you are unfamiliar with the game.

Skeleton code has been written for you, though you do not need to use it. If you use the skeleton code, you should define the body of main and the body of the functions in gameboard.c. For example output, see example*.txt. Files to turn in:

<ol>

 <li>c</li>

 <li>c</li>

 <li>h</li>

 <li>Makefile</li>

</ol>

We must be able to create your code on the command line using make.
